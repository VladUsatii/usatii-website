We cluster queries into problem, solution, and brand terms, then estimate volume and difficulty to inform long-form and short-form anchors.\n- We capture questions, objections, and phrasing from comments, subreddits, TikTok Q&A, Twitter threads, Discords, and review sites to better understand the space.\n- We identify seasonal spikes, product launch cycles, and news hooks to time campaigns - mostly from adjacent categories.\n\nWhen it is time to validate hooks:\n\n- We run a hook lab, where we transform insights into 20–40 testable hooks per pillar (promise, pattern interrupt, tension, proof).\n- Rapid A/Bs with polls, small-budget boosts, and community samples to verify interest.\n\nThen it is time to create a content calendar.\n\n### Content calendar\n\n- Convert research into 3–5 pillars (education, comparison, proof, POV, community, depending on the niche) and name recurring series that audiences recognize.\n- Cadence & channel fit is done by assigning formats and posting rhythm by platform (TikTok/Shorts/Reels/LinkedIn/X/YouTube), optimizing for watch time and saves.\n- We also maintain a repo of hooks, intros, and CTAs.\n\n### KPIs & Analysis\n- We track retention (A3/A5 hold), CTR, save/share rate, comments per view, and conversion assists.\n- Content R&D is done by feeding winners back into the calendar, iterating on near-misses, and retiring low-signal pillars.\n- The voice of the customer is of utmost importance. Continuously harvest phrasing from DMs, sales calls, and support tickets to sharpen scripts and captions.",
